# Barcode Lookup
[![Dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/david/feedhenry-templates/barcode-reader-service.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/feedhenry-templates/barcode-reader-service)

This service looks up a barcode by UPC id. It connects with a SOAP service, takes a mixed SOAP and CSV response, and returns JSON back to the client, more effectively mobilising the service.

# Requirements 

The service will only work with node 4 and above. See package.json for more details.
